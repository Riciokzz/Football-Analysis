# European Football Analysis

An analysis is presented in FootballAnalysis.ipynb

## Introduction

The aim of this work is to analyze the dataset of football matches and find useful insights which could help business with managing the teams or predicting winners.

We will check for corrupted data, correlations and relation of features. We will perform statistical inference, form hypotheses base by what we find and create machine learning model to predict matches.

The work objectives are as follows:

<li>Find useful insights in our data.</li>
<li>Find best league, best team and best player.</li>
<li>Create machine learning model which predict scores per match.</li>
<li>Create machine learning model which predict who win the match.</li>


Dataset structure:
    <li>Country</li>
    <li>League</li>
    <li>Match</li>
    <li>Player</li>
